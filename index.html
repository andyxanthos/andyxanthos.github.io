                    In order to get the opinions of others, I contacted people who are currently working as programmers and asked them to participate in a ten question survey.
                    One participant was able to speak with me in person, while the remaining participants responded through email. The in-person interview was documented
                    in the form of notes, while the remaining interviews were documented in whole because they were sent by email.

                    The participants in this study consist of three people who are currently working as programmers. Importantly, they indicated that their jobs required them to teach
                    others about programming topics and concepts. The participants were initially contacted by an email asking them if they would be interested in participating. It is 
                    noteworthy that all of the participants have a friendly or familial relationship with me.
